Over the last three decades, a vivid self-organised, autonomous lesbian & queer
feminist activism has been flourishing in Ljubljana that intertwined autonomy with squatting.
From building up spaces, communities and festivals to group encounters on the demonstrations,
there have also been constant efforts to build up sister\*hood in the regional postYugoslav space and internationally.

The presentation will try to explore complexities and continuities among Ljubljana´s autonomus
lesbian & queer feminist initiatives and position them in the context of the postYugoslav lesbian
and queer activism. It will also touch upon challenges how to co-build regional lesbian and queer
feminist archives of memory.

The presentation will arise from the eponymous article co-written by Maja Pan and Teja Oblak,
that was published in the book Sisterhood And Unity: Lesbian Activism in the Post-Yugoslav Space
(Bilić B., Radoman M., eds.; Springer, 2018). Join us with your reflections and thoughts!

The presentation will be made by Teja Oblak. She comes from Ljubljana, where she collaborates
with Lesbian Feminist University and with the feminist radio show Sektor Z at Radio Student.
